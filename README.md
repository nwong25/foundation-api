# Atolla Technical Exercises

# Instructions

1. Front-end: Design a react component that includes an input. Underneath the input, a list of characters will be generated as an auto complete based on data from an API.
2. Back-End: Write an API of your choice or share code of API you have built in the past.
3. Pseudocode the models you would envision for all these data inputs. What kind of database would you use and why?
4. Describe potential data structures to store information on the changes in these factors over time? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each structure? Cases to consider: - Frequency of skin measurements (could be monthly, quarterly) - Changes in product routine (could be as frequent as weekly) - Changes in main skin concerns - Changes in lifestyle
